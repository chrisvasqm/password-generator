# Password Generator

Demostration project to show how to make a monorepo project that allows users to create a random generated password based on parameters.

## Getting Started

This is a monorepo, so you will find the `backend` and `frontend` living under the same roof, each in their perspective folders.

In order to start it up, you must first install the dependencies from each project.

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then start the `backend` first and then the `frontend` by doing the following command from each project's folder:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then your default browser should open up and take you to `http://localhost:3001` where the user interface will show.
